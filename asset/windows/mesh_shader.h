    Overview:

        Shader program 'mesh':
            Get shader desc: mesh_shader_desc(sg_query_backend());
            Vertex shader: mesh_vs
                Attribute slots:
                    ATTR_mesh_vs_xyuv = 0
                    ATTR_mesh_vs_rgba = 1
                Uniform block 'mesh_vs_params':
                    C struct: mesh_vs_params_t
                    Bind slot: SLOT_mesh_vs_params = 0
            Fragment shader: mesh_fs
                Image 'tex':
                    Type: SG_IMAGETYPE_2D
                    Component Type: SG_SAMPLERTYPE_FLOAT
                    Bind slot: SLOT_tex = 0


    Shader descriptor structs:

        sg_shader mesh = sg_make_shader(mesh_shader_desc(sg_query_backend()));

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'mesh_vs':

        sg_pipeline pip = sg_make_pipeline(&(sg_pipeline_desc){
            .layout = {
                .attrs = {
                    [ATTR_mesh_vs_xyuv] = { ... },
                    [ATTR_mesh_vs_rgba] = { ... },
                },
            },
            ...});

    Image bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs_images[] or .fs_images[]

        SLOT_tex = 0;

    Bind slot and C-struct for uniform block 'mesh_vs_params':

        mesh_vs_params_t mesh_vs_params = {
            .proj = ...;
            .model = ...;
        };
        sg_apply_uniforms(SG_SHADERSTAGE_[VS|FS], SLOT_mesh_vs_params, &SG_RANGE(mesh_vs_params));
