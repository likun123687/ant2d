    Overview:

        Shader program 'debug':
            Get shader desc: debug_shader_desc(sg_query_backend());
            Vertex shader: debug_vs
                Attribute slots:
                    ATTR_debug_vs_xyuv = 0
                    ATTR_debug_vs_rgba = 1
                Uniform block 'debug_vs_proj':
                    C struct: debug_vs_proj_t
                    Bind slot: SLOT_debug_vs_proj = 0
            Fragment shader: debug_fs
                Image 'tex':
                    Type: SG_IMAGETYPE_2D
                    Component Type: SG_SAMPLERTYPE_FLOAT
                    Bind slot: SLOT_tex = 0


    Shader descriptor structs:

        sg_shader debug = sg_make_shader(debug_shader_desc(sg_query_backend()));

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'debug_vs':

        sg_pipeline pip = sg_make_pipeline(&(sg_pipeline_desc){
            .layout = {
                .attrs = {
                    [ATTR_debug_vs_xyuv] = { ... },
                    [ATTR_debug_vs_rgba] = { ... },
                },
            },
            ...});

    Image bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs_images[] or .fs_images[]

        SLOT_tex = 0;

    Bind slot and C-struct for uniform block 'debug_vs_proj':

        debug_vs_proj_t debug_vs_proj = {
            .projection = ...;
        };
        sg_apply_uniforms(SG_SHADERSTAGE_[VS|FS], SLOT_debug_vs_proj, &SG_RANGE(debug_vs_proj));
